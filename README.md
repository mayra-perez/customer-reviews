# Using Customer Analytics for the Development of a Differentiation Strategy

## Abstract

Competition in the natural Mexican bottled sauce industry is growing. According to Technavio Research, the general market category is projected to increase by $113.85 billion through 2026 in North America alone. As more companies emerge with the promise of tradition-inspired, clean products, the importance of differentiation becomes more pronounced. Using original sampling methods, this project will analyze online customers reviews (OCR) on three dairy-free, gluten-free brands available at grocery stores in the Greater Los Angeles area: Frontera, Hatch Chili Company, and Siete Family Foods. Insights drawn from sentiment analysis and text analytics will inform a differentiation strategy for a new venture.

## Context

Established companies in the natural Mexican bottled sauce industry pose barriers to entry for new companies looking to enter the market with fewer resources and brand awareness. Established companies’ trusted company image may motivate existing customers to pay premium prices for products perceived as high quality. Similarly, their strong supplier networks may support low-cost production and thus more desirable and accessible products. New companies looking to introduce a viable substitute in this contested space must demonstrate differentiation. In a crowded market, how is a new entrant’s product different yet comparable?

Understanding target consumers is critical for new companies looking to enter a competitive market space. According to software company SAS, customer analytics can deliver “valuable insights into consumer habits and lifestyle preferences.” Consumer reviews on similar products offered by competitors can provide intelligence on where companies are leading and where they are lacking. This is a unique opportunity to identify features, consumer characteristics, and further inform the development a differentiation strategy in a saturated market.

## Proposal

Market research indicates consumers of natural food products are increasingly health- and planet-conscious. They purchase products that are clean, indulgent, and economical. For Millennial consumers, food is also an extension of experience and representation. Companies such as Frontera, Hatch Chili Company, and Siete Family Foods successfully deliver on these values and do so at different price points. The central question for this project is – within the gluten-free, dairy-free Mexican foods industry – what distinguishes one brand from another? Are there additional insights to consider? Do these companies offer something beyond brand reputation? Are there any unmet needs?

Using original sampling methods, I aim to compile a dataset of ~1,500 Amazon customer reviews on three dairy-free, gluten-free brands available at grocery stores in the Greater Los Angeles area: Frontera, Hatch Chili Company, and Siete Family Foods. While customer reviews do not contain demographic information, these brands typically cater to health- and planet-conscious consumers. The products are sold in natural grocery stores, such as Whole Foods Market and Sprouts (comparable to Natural Grocers, Market of Choice or New Seasons in the Pacific Northwest). Therefore, insights can be used to learn more about this target consumer. 

Depending on the state of the final dataset, customer reviews will be analyzed using sentiment or textual analysis to identify key themes, trends, and other important patterns. I expect to find substantive product reviews that reveal consumer behavior and preferences beyond what is presented by prominent market research firms. Furthermore, my hope is to find quality insights that can be used to develop a differentiation strategy for a new venture.

## Conclusion

The growth of the natural Mexican foods industry is turning up the heat on established and emerging competitors. As new entrepreneurs enter the market with similar value propositions, the importance of differentiation becomes more pressing. This project aims to analyze Amazon.com customer reviews on three dairy-free, gluten-free brands available at grocery stores in the Greater Los Angeles area: Frontera, Hatch Chili Company, and Siete Family Foods. The results will provide intelligence on where companies are leading and where they are lacking. Key themes, trends, and other important patterns will help inform a differentiation strategy in a saturated market.

If data quality proves successful, the sampling and analysis techniques used for this project may be generalizable to future projects will similar objectives. If so, the project would be an excellent data science business case. The methods could potentially be documented and made them available to other graduate or early-career data scientists for replication.

However, the primary concern for this project is data quality. Most customer reviews may not be substantive, or they may be related to other factors, such as poor delivery or packaging (which may be more reflective of the distributor and not the product). These will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If data quality proves to be poor at the end of this project, lessons could potentially be documented for future consideration.
